# Multi YOLO V5——Detection and Semantic Segmentation
## Overeview
This is a part of my master project which based on <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5"> ultralytics YOLO V5 tag v5.0</a>.  
This multi-task model adds only a small amount of computation and inferential GPU memory (about 350MB) and is able to accomplish both object detection and semantic segmentation. Object detection metrics are slightly improved (compared to single-task YOLO) on my dataset (transfer from Cityscapes Instance Segmentation labels) and Cityscapes semantic segmentation metrics are shown below.
